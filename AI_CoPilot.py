Here's an optimized version of the code:

```python


class APIRequester:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key

    def make_request(self, url):
        while True:
            try:
                response = requests.get(url)
                response.raise_for_status()
                return response.json()
            except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
                print(f"Request Exception: {err}")
                time.sleep(5)

    def fetch_data(self, endpoint):
        url = f"https://api.example.com/{endpoint}?api_key={self.api_key}"
        return self.make_request(url)


api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
user = "john_doe"

api_requester = APIRequester(api_key)
financial_data = {
    'income': 5000,
    'expenses': [1000, 2000, 500]
}

url = f"https://api.example.com/financial_data?user={user}&api_key={api_key}"
data = api_requester.make_request(url)

if data:
    print(f"Your income: {data['income']}")
    print(f"Your expenses: {data['expenses']}")
    print(f"Your savings: {data['savings']}")
    print(f"Your investment portfolio: {data['investment_portfolio']}")
else:
    print("No data found.")

total_expenses = sum(data['expenses'])
savings = data['income'] - total_expenses
print(
    f"Based on your income of {data['income']} and expenses of {total_expenses}, your savings can be {savings}.")

print("Here are some potential cost-cutting measures:")
for expense in data['expenses']:
    if expense > data['income'] * 0.2:
        suggestion = f"Reduce {expense} by 10%"
    else:
        suggestion = f"Cut {expense} by 5%"
    print(suggestion)

profile = "Moderate risk, long-term investor"
print(
    f"Based on your risk tolerance of {data['risk_tolerance']} and investment horizon of {data['investment_horizon']}, your investment profile is {profile}.")

time.sleep(60)
```

In the optimized version, unnecessary classes and functions are removed. The financial data is obtained directly from the API using the `APIRequester` class . The data is then printed and used to calculate savings and suggest cost-cutting measures. Finally, the program sleeps for 60 seconds before exiting.
