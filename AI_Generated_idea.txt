I have a Python project idea that meets your requirements. How about creating an autonomous AI-powered personal finance assistant? This program will provide financial guidance, budgeting assistance, and investment recommendations for the average working-class individual. Here's how it could work:

1. Data Collection: The program will autonomously fetch financial data from legitimate sources, such as stock data APIs, economic indicators, and news feeds. It will use HuggingFace small models for natural language processing (NLP) to gather relevant financial information.

2. Personal Finance Analysis: The program will analyze the user's financial data, including income, expenses, savings, and investment portfolio. It will use AI algorithms to identify areas of improvement, such as reducing unnecessary expenses or optimizing investment strategies.

3. Budgeting: The program will assist the user in creating a personalized budget based on their income and financial goals. It will take into account the user's expenses, prioritize savings, and suggest areas where the user can potentially cut costs.

4. Investment Recommendations: Using machine learning algorithms, the program will evaluate the user's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. It will provide personalized investment recommendations, considering factors such as diversification, asset allocation, and market trends. The program will not provide financial advice but will offer insights and suggestions for the user to consider.

5. Real-Time Monitoring: The program will continuously monitor the user's financial data and investment portfolio. It will provide alerts for significant market events, portfolio volatility, or deviations from the user's budget. These real-time notifications will enable the user to stay informed and make timely financial decisions.

6. Automation: The program will automate routine financial tasks, such as bill payments, account reconciliation, and expense tracking. It can integrate with banking systems, payment gateways, and expense management tools to streamline these processes for the user.

7. Performance Tracking: The program will track the user's financial progress and provide visualizations and reports to help them understand their financial situation. It will calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as savings rate, investment returns, and debt reduction progress.

8. Security and Privacy: The program will prioritize data security and privacy by implementing industry-standard encryption measures and adhering to data protection regulations. Personal financial data will be stored securely and accessed only by the user.

By creating an autonomous AI-powered personal finance assistant, the average working-class individual can benefit from personalized financial guidance and gain better control over their financial well-being. The program operates autonomously without relying on web scraping or local files, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
