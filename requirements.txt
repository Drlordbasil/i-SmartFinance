To generate the requirements.txt file, we need to identify the package requirements in the given Python code. 

Based on the code, the package requirements are as follows:

- requests
- matplotlib

You can create a requirements.txt file with these requirements by running the following command in your terminal or command line:

```
$ echo "requests" > requirements.txt
$ echo "matplotlib" >> requirements.txt
```

This will create a requirements.txt file with the specified package requirements.
